                <h3>So much information is being lost, lets store it!</h3>
				<p>The idea behind this project initially was to store the encoding for the buttons/commands from all of the random remote controls
					(both IR and RF-based) I have in my house/garage.  I figured other folks probably had the same issue, and if they had lost a remote they needed,
					but had a <a href="https://flipperzero.one/">FlipperZero</a> and cloned the <a href="https://github.com/jdub-2000/flipper_clicker_lib">Flipper Clicker Lib project repo</a>,they could 
					regain lost functionality and keep things out of the landifll just a little bit longer.  I'll footstomp this through this site: 
					<b> mending is better than ending </b> in so many ways.  Anyways, I started using my own FlipperZero to snarf up the transmissions
					of several devices that I needed to store or thought might be of use, and I hosted them on github.

				<p>I haven't updated it in a while, so I might find something interesting to include first...</p>
